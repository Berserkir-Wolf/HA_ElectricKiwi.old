# Electric Kiwi Sensors

Documentation for this will be written up for now, but will eventually be migrated to the hass integration page (if Electric Kiwi officially approve the project).  
This uses the [Electric Kiwi Juice Hacker API](https://berserkir-wolf.github.io/HA_ElectricKiwi/) to return usage details to Home Assistant for the Energy dashboard to display.

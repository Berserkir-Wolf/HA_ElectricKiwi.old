# Electric Kiwi Sensors

Documentation for this will be written up here to start with, but will likely be migrated to the hass integration page (if Electric Kiwi officially approve the project).  

This custom component for Home Assistant will be using the [Electric Kiwi Juice Hacker API](https://berserkir-wolf.github.io/HA_ElectricKiwi/) to return usage details to Home Assistant for the Energy dashboard to display.

This site will be... outdated. Very quickly. Especially given it requires pushing to main to update. Where possible I will do what I can to work around this, but as it is my first proper custom component I'm being cautious around what I have it do.
